Little くコ:彡 has picked a secret number between 0 and 100,000,000! Can you guess it?
You have 3 attempts to find the correct number, or you'll have to wait before trying again. If you guess correctly, you'll get the flag!
But is this really just a game of luck? Or is there a way to predict the number?
